In this article, I will try to iron out my vision on the current status of Static Website, and how I dealt with the development of my new <a href="https://baptiste.debever.co">website</a>.
First of all, it's worth mentioning that I already have a website before, I could have kept it going - but, while I was starting to draw up new content, I came up with this idea: "Ok - let's learn something new by building a new website, it will allow me to flesh out the design and keep going forward".

## Framework choice

As I was flicking through the different possibilities for a simple website / blog / portfolio, I was quickly overwhelmed by the number of existing new stuff out there.

In a nutshell, here are the different tech I ran into:
- Static Website Generator such as `Hugo`, `Jekyll`, `Hexo`, and so forth. Well, it's good, fast, reliable, but not that interesting for my case, as you don't really interact with the core language but, if anything, with a "wrapper".
- Simple website using a bunch of html, javascript (potentially a framework or library) and some styling
- CLI provided by one of the trendy Javascript Framework: `Angular`, `React.js`, `Vue.js

I already had a little experiment with Vue.js, so I opted for that.

However, one problem persisted: how to bypass the <i>Virtual DOM</i>, in other words, how to make the robot (ie. crawler) able to sift through all your content. That's being said, they should now be able to crawl your synchronous content though.

That's when I discovered <a href="https://nuxtjs.org" target="_blank">Nuxt.js</a>, a higher-level framework, built on top of `Vue.js'` CLI, that can be used with a CLI command to create universal Vue applications. 
What's even more stunning, is that this framework comes with <b>Server-Side Rendering, ES6 compilation, and a powerful routing system</b> out of the box: <i>AWESOME! </i>

Which then mean that I won't have to worry about SEO, as the search engine crawlers will directly see the fully rendered page.
Last but not least, this top-notch tool can be used along with Vue.js module, so you can easily integrate a Markdwon plugin: deal!

## Small thoughts on Vue.js

As I mentioned, I opted for `Vue.js`, which is one of the top trending Javascript framework, so it's worth get used to it. What's more, just to make a quick point, I really like the simplicity of this framework, everything seems straightforward and the learning curve is anything but steep.
In term of mobile development, it's not yet as fitted as Angular (with `Ionic` for instance) and React though - but given the community around Vue.js, it will definitely come sooner or later.

## Toward a Progressive Web

Last but not least, in this research of fancy and recent tech, I tried to build a PWA in the meantime - PWA stands for Progressive Web App, which, basically, uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like user experience (ie. offline mode, push notifications, faster experience, caching, etc.).
I have unfortunately not finished this piece of work yet - but it should in the air soon though.

To finish this up this article, I still needed to deploy my website.
I already own my domain names, but, how do I deploy this fancy tech to the server? Well, a lot of possibilities open themselves to me.

Although I could have use the static generator method provided by Nuxt (ie. `npm generate`) and deploy it on any shared hosting - I don't want my website to be a full "static website".
That's why I looked for something fancier which will allow me to deploy in a few commands (eg. on commit) and run `nuxt build` and `nuxt start` for me.
I eventually end up using Heroku - along with Github to disclose my code - as the deployment tool. Thanks to a simple configuration, I simply have to push my code to Github, and Heroku takes care of the deployment/building process. If an error comes up, get notified! :)

I hope you enjoyed this article. 
Please not that this website was actually built in a rush - as it's definitely ones of my number 1 priority: but it's efficient and it does the job!
