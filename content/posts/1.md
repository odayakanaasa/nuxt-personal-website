In this article, I will detail my vision, and how I dealt with the development of my new website.
First of all, it's worth mentioning that I already have a website before, I could have keep it going - but, as I was starting to draw up new content, I came up with this idea: "Ok - let's learn something new by building a new website, which will allow me to flesh out the design of the old one in the mean time".

## Framework choice

As I was flicking through the different possibilities, I was quickly overwhelmed by the number of existing new stuff out there.

To be short, here are the different tech I ran into:
- Static Website Generator such as Hugo, Jekyll, Hexo, and so forth. Well, it's good, fast, reliable, but not that interesting for my case, as you don't really interact with the core language but, if anything, with a "wrapper".
-
- CLI provided by one of the trendy Javascript Framework: Angular, React.js, Vue.js

```
<script type="text/javascript">
$awesomeVar = ''
</script>

```

## Building the website

As I mentioned, I opted for Vue.js, which is one of the top trending Javascript framework, so it's worth get used to it. What's more, just to make a quick point, I really like the simplicity of this framework, everything seems straightforward and the learning curve is anything but steep, ie. it's really easy to catch on and keep up.
In term of mobile development, it's not yet as fitted as Angular (with Ionic for instance) and React though - but given the community around Vue.js, it will definitely come sooner or later.

## Design of this website

First of all, I'd like to thank my friend Shane Taylor, Senior UX/UI designer in London, who designed my logo and helped my out to improve the branding.

Then, in term of styling, I aimed for something usual and not really exceptional: Bootstrap.
Nonetheless, it's worth mentioning that I tried to used best practices in term of development: I used the Sass pre-processor, and not sheer CSS. Besides, I used to Gulp.js to compile, minify and load all the other libraries managed by the famous NPM. Finally, Nuxt.js comes with Eslint out of the box, so all my Javascript code has been "sifted", if I can say so.

## Toward a Progressive Web

Last but not least, in this research of top-notch and recent tech, I tried to build a PWA in the meantime. For your information, PWA stands for Progressive Web App, which, basically, uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like user experience (ie. offline mode, push notifications, faster experience, caching, etc.) - and any website can be turned into a PWA.


To wrap up this article, let's deal with the deployment.
I already own my domain names, but, how do I deploy this fancy tech to the server? Well, a lot of possibilities open themselves to me.

Although I could have use the static generator method provided by Nuxt (ie. `npm generate`) and deploy it on any shared hosting - I don't want my website to be a full "static website".
That's why I looked for something fancier which will allow me to deploy in a few commands (eg. on commit) and run `nuxt build` and `nuxt start` for me.file is all `markdown`. Checkout some lorem ipsum mark down below!
